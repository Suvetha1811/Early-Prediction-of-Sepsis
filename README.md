# Early-Prediction-of-Sepsis
The goal of the project is the early detection of sepsis.
The early prediction of sepsis is potentially life saving and to predict sepsis 6 hours before the clinical prediction of sepsis.
Late prediction of sepsis is potentially life threatening and also consumes heavy hospital resources.
